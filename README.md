## Introduction
<p>This is my submission for the first programming assignment in the
Exploratory Data Analysis course.</p>
<p>The assignment consisted in a series of plots that had to 
be (re)constructed from a specific data set,
using the capabilities of the base plotting system in R.</p>
<p>As requested, I'm submitting 4 plots (named plot1.png, plot2.png, 
plot3.png and plot4.png) and also the respective R code files
used for constructing them (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R).</p>
<p>In order to favor reproductibility, the R code files include not only
the code to draw the plots, but also to read the data.</p>
<p>Please note that I am assuming that the contents of the zip file 
have been extracted previously and the file "household_power_consumption.txt"
is in the working directory.</p>
